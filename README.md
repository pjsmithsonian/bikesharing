## Overview
To determine the potential business opportunities of the NYC Citibike share model in other areas, we are analyzing the Citibike data from NYC from August of 2019. This analysis, found [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/pj.smith#!/vizhome/NYCCitibikeAnalysis_16179334931600/BikeAnalysisStory?publish=yes), will give a good idea as to the market that may exist as well as when the peak hours of demand are in order to meet that demand.

## Results
The following analysis shows the NYC Citibike usage for August.

### Checkout Times
The majority of bike checkouts are short, but there are a lot of trips lasting an hour or more. There does appear to be more men than women or unknown gender riders for these short checkouts, but as the length of ride is longer, all genders are roughly the same.

### Peak Usage Times
Commuting times during the week are our most densely populated trip times, but over the weekend the late morning to afternoons are all very busy.

Regardless of gender, the peak times of bike checkouts is consistent with what we have seen.

From the month of August, we see that our highest usage hours are the 8-9 AM and 4-8 PM time slots.

### User Base
From our data, males seem to be the majority of our subscriber population and utilize the service very regularly.

## Summary
The above analyisis have helped us to gain a much better understanding of the Citibike in New York City. To determine if this is a viable business outside of NYC, we would need additional analysis, however.

### Additional Analysis
The additional analysis that would be helpful would be:
 - Density of businesses in target city (Des Moines, Iowa for our purposes)
 - Number of tourists for the target city per year
 
This additional information will assist us as our average bike rental duration was relatively short. This is likely due to the density of activites and businesses in NYC so less distance has to be travelled. We are not likely to attract much interest if there is a lot of distance between desired locations.

Also, as one would imagine in a city of NYC, there is likely a large tourist population which contributes to usage. Knowing the average amount of tourists on a yearly basis would help to also determine demand in these busier summer months.
